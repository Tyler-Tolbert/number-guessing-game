# Number Guessing Game

A number guessing game is a game where players try to guess a randomly generated number within a certain range. The game may have a set limit of attempts, and players are usually given feedback on whether their guess is too high or too low. The player who correctly guesses the number within the allotted attempts wins the game. It can be a single player or multiple player game.
